# Splinter API Examples
Various examples of Python scripts built using the Splinter API. 

**Why this Repo?**

I really enjoyed working with the Splinter API and felt its simple and yet has wide examples and wanted to explore what I could do with it.

**What is the Splinter API ?**

Splinter is an open source tool for testing web applications using Python. It lets you automate browser actions, such as visiting URLs and interacting with their items.

**What are these examples?**

These are Python scripts using the Splinter API used to automate some browser related tasks. More specifically what each of the examples do are listed below, and I have included comments wherever needed to increase readability.

**List of Examples covered:**

1. ***Check If your website/domain appears during a particular Google search:*** This simple script can be used to check if your website/domain appears in the search results when someone searches for a cetain keyword/phrase. [See example1.py]
-> The script in Example1 checks whether my github page appears in the search results when someone searched my name. 

2. ***Quick Screenshot:*** This script takes a screenshot of the page in the mentioned URL. This is useful for quick taking a screenshot by providing the URL without actually having to manually go to that page. [See example2.py]
-> The script takes the screenshot of my personal website and stores the image in the directory of the scipt as screenshot.png

3. ***Fill out secure forms (AutoFill MWS Scratchpad credentials):*** This script is an example of how you would be able to fill out secure forms. [See example3.py]. 
      -> The script in this example fills out the text fields for the MWS scratchpad. This is useful because developers working with the MWS API need to input the credentials everytime they use the scratchpad(which is pretty often) and the keys are quite large.
